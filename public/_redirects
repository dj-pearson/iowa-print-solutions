# React Router SPA redirects - must be last rule
# This catches all routes that don't match static files and sends them to index.html
# so React Router can handle client-side routing

# Redirect common extensions to prevent 404s
*.js /assets/:splat 200
*.css /assets/:splat 200

# Handle API routes if any (none currently)
/api/* /api/:splat 200

# Redirect all other routes to index.html for React Router
/* /index.html 200
