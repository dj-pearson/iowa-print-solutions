# Emergency MIME Type Fix - HashRouter Alternative

## Current Issue
Assets still serving as HTML despite multiple redirect configurations. This suggests a fundamental Cloudflare Pages configuration issue.

## Emergency Solution: Switch to HashRouter

If MIME type issues persist, switch React Router to use hash-based routing which doesn't require server-side redirect configuration.

### Step 1: Update App.jsx
```javascript
// Change from:
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'

// To:
import { HashRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom'
```

### Step 2: Update _redirects (simplified)
```
# Only handle actual missing files, let HashRouter handle routes
/assets/*  200
/*  /index.html  200
```

## Cloudflare Pages Troubleshooting

### Check These Settings in Cloudflare Dashboard:

1. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`
   - Root directory: (empty)
   
2. **Environment Variables:**
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `CI=false` (sometimes needed for React builds)

3. **Cache Settings:**
   - Clear cache completely
   - Try "Purge Everything" in Cloudflare cache

4. **Preview vs Production:**
   - Test on Cloudflare preview URL first
   - Check if custom domain has different behavior

### Asset Filename Mismatch Investigation

The error shows `index-B73lrzgM.js` but we built `index-Bb3hCfPB.js`. This could mean:

1. **Old cached build on Cloudflare**
2. **Multiple deployments with different builds**
3. **Browser cache serving old HTML with old asset references**

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Force rebuild on Cloudflare:**
   - Trigger new deployment
   - Clear all Cloudflare cache
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Test current build locally:**
   - `npm run preview`
   - Check if assets load correctly on `http://localhost:4173`

3. **Verify asset existence:**
   - Check if `/assets/index-Bv3NC5aP.css` exists in dist
   - Check if `/assets/index-Bb3hCfPB.js` exists in dist

## Files Modified for Testing

- **Removed:** `functions/` (backed up to `functions_backup/`)
- **Removed:** `public/_headers` (backed up to `public/_headers_backup`)
- **Simplified:** `_redirects` to standard Vite + Cloudflare pattern

## If All Else Fails: HashRouter Implementation

```javascript
// src/App.jsx
import React from 'react'
import { HashRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
// ... rest remains the same
```

HashRouter uses URL fragments (#/route) which don't require server-side routing configuration.

**Trade-off:** URLs look like `/#/about` instead of `/about`, but all functionality works.

## Current Status
- ✅ Minimal configuration deployed
- ✅ Functions disabled for testing
- ✅ Headers disabled for testing  
- ✅ Standard Vite + Cloudflare redirects in place
- ⚠️ MIME type issues may be Cloudflare-side caching/configuration

**Next: Test deployment with minimal config, then implement HashRouter if needed.**
